I am a PhD student at [ONERA (DTIS/IVA)](https://www.onera.fr/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) under the supervision of [Aurélien Plyer](https://github.com/aplyer), [Alexandre Boulch](https://aboulch.github.io/), and [Guy Le Besnerais](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=r8V306wAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao).

My main areas of research are computer vision and machine learning. I am currently working on deep learning-based approaches for multi-frame optical flow estimation.
